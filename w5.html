<h1> Rotation 5 </h1>

<p>For this rotation, we got introduced to 3D printing and meshmixer. We got our faces scanned and we put it into the meshmixer software and I put a column below my scanned torso and I put this into the makerbot print software and from there I set the up the design for the 3D printer and printed it and it came out pretty good. The file of the design from makerbot print is in the file list below.</p>
