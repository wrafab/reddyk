<h1> Rotation 6 </h1>

<p> For this week, we made skate boards and the first thing we had to do was glue our skateboards and then I got the glued board in the bag then I vaccumed out the air out of the bag then waited for 24 hours then after that I took the board out of the bag and sanded it to make to look good then i printed a vinyl sticker with my name and I put it on the board and it took me some time to get the sticker on right without the sticker ripping. I made the sticker by going onto the software on the computer for printing stickers and putting my name by using the text tool then I put the appriate amount of vinyl for the sticker to come out correctly and when I did that I ran the job through the machine and after that I took the vinyl out and I went through a specific process of taking the sticker out without ripping the vinyl or sticker when removing it then I put them on the board. Then we made chocolate molds by first sending an stl model which I made by editing the stl file of my torso and head to a file of my head to Mr.Gerber and from there we put in the negative which was Smooth-Sil 960 into the blue casting and it formed the mold after leaving it for a few hours which I was able to use to make a chocolate mold of my head by pouring chocolate into the mold and put it in a fridge and when it cooled I got a chocolate mold of my head that I can have to eat. </p>
