<h1> Rotation 6 </h1>

<p> For this week, we made skate boards and the first thing we had to do was glue our skateboards and then I got the glued board in the bag then I vaccumed out the air out of the bag then waited for 24 hours then after that I took the board out of the bag and sanded it to make to look good then i printed a vinyl sticker with my name and I put it on the board and it took me some time to get the sticker on right without the sticker ripping. Then we made chocolate molds by first sending an stl model of our heads to Mr.Gerber and from there we put in the negative which was Smooth-Sil 960 into the blue casting and it formed the mold which I was able to use to make a chocolate mold of my head.
