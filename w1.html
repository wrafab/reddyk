 <p> For the first week, we learned the basics of HTML to make our websites and after it was taught to us we did some challenges. The first challenge is that we had to make a support so that a golf ball will not touch the ground if it is bounced from different heights, and the second challenge is that we have to make the tallest structure with newspapers and tape (the second picture shows our group doing this challenge).</p>
