 <p> For the first week, we learned the basics of HTML to make our websites and after it was taught to us we did some challenges. The first challenge is that we had to make a support so that a golf ball will not touch the ground if it is bounced from different heights, and during this challenge our group wanted a box like structure so that golf ball will bounce on the structure without hitting the ground and I suggested that we cut the straws so we have more supplies to build our structure and it made it easier for us to create our structure. The second challenge is that we have to make the tallest structure with newspapers and tape (the picture shows our group doing this challenge), and in this challenge I helped with making sure that the top of the structure stays straight and I helped out with on how to make sure the base for the structure is good.</p>
