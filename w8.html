<h1> Rotation 8 </h1>

 <p> For this week, we learned about embroidery and sewing machines and how to use them. For Embroidery, I first picked out a grey hat to put my design which was my initials then I set up the hat by putting the hat between two extremely strong magnents with a shet of material that allows the design to stay, and after that I put it on the machine in which I set up the job by putting in what I wanted to embroider and from there it gave a very easy step by step process of focusing the hat and confirming what color I want in string and then after confirming all the factors in the embroidery job on the machine I started the job and the design looks nice on the hat. Then for the sewing I made a christmas pillow case by learning how to connect two pieces of fabrics then I pick the fabrics I wanted for the pillow case then I cut the fabrics so that the measurment of each part is correct then I ironed the fabrics to prevent wrinkles. After that I pinned the sides of the pillowcase then I sewed the sides then I turned it inside out and I sewed there as well then after that I turned the pillowcase again to its normal side then i pinned and sewed the sides again to finish it off and it looks amazing.</p>
