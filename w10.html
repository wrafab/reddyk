<h1> Rotation 10 </h1>

<p> For my final project I made a table that can be ablso used as a shelf to hold my books and stuff for school. The four projects used during for the final project are Design, 3D printing, Laser Cutting, and Woodworking.</p>  
<b>
<p> The materials and devices used for the project were the laser cutter, the 3D printers, and the wood saws. For the wood cutter, I used the machine with the 1/8 wood seeting, and I used the standered setting with the smartextruder + setting when saving the file for the 3D printer, and there was no general setting for the wood saws. It took me about two classes and a couple hours over the weekend to finish the project. I learned from this project were how to use the different wood saws and wood-working tools in the WIC.</p>
