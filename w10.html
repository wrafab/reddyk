<h1> Rotation 10 </h1>

<p> For my final project I made a table that can be ablso used as a shelf to hold my books and stuff for school. The four projects used during for the final project are Design, 3D printing, Laser Cutting, and Woodworking.</p>  
<b>
<p> The devices used for the project were the laser cutter, the 3D printers, and the wood saws. For the wood cutter, I used the machine with the 1/8 wood seeting, and I used the standered setting with the smartextruder + setting when saving the file for the 3D printer, and there was no general setting for the wood saws. It took me about two classes and a couple hours over the weekend to finish the project. I learned from this project were how to use the different wood saws and wood-working tools in the WIC.</p>  
<b>
<p> The materials used are wood, the materials used in the 3D printer, and the paint I used to paint the final piece.</p>
<b> 
<p> The process of making the Final Project</p>
<b>
<p> First aspect is the design part, and I did this by first making a CorrelDraw file that would engrave my name in the laser cutter. The next file is when I wanted to make a platform to have a coaster like function for a cup or any other small object, so I made it with on Autodesk which I put into Makerbot print and then put the job into the machine.</p>
<b>  
<p> The next aspect of the project was the laser cutting, and I did this putting a blank piece of wood that had the correct dimensions, and then I focused the laser cutter then I put the job into the computer connected to machine then started the job and waited for the machine to laser cut my name into the wood which I sprayed after the job finished.</p>
<b>
<p> The next aspect was the 3D printer. This aspect is a matter of saving the makerbot print file onto a flash drive then putting it into a 3D printer, and waiting for the job to be done. Then I spraypainted the 3D design green after it came out then I hot glued to the top of the table below the engraving of my name.</p>  
<b>
<p> The last aspect is woodworking. This aspect is that I put the large but thin piece of wood with my name engraving on the top then I had 6 collumn like pieces of wood with the same dimensions. I glued the pieces as a way to connect the two platforms of wood. the platform with the name engraving should be on top with the name being on the top of the table/shelf. Then I spraypainted the rest of the project that was not painted before, and let it dry.</p>
