<h1> Rotation 3 </h1>

<p> For this week, we got to use the UV printer, the sawgrass printer, and the garmat printer. For the UV printer I made a popsocket with the cavaliers logo on it. I did this by put setting up the machine so that it would be still and prepared for the job then I followed the process that Mr.Gerber gave us and I was able to make my caveliers pop-socket. For the Garmat printer, I had to make a shirt that represents hudson or ohio so I made a shirt with the phrase, "There is no state like the Buckeye State," with a picture with the idea that ohio is the Buckeye state. To make this I used the garment software needed to print it then I put the file onto a flash drive then I put the file in the computer and set the job on the computer, but before I just put the shirt into the printer I prepped by putting onto a press that would get rid of any wrinkles that shirt would have then I put the shirt into printer immediatly then I placed the into the press to make sure that the ink from the job doesn't smear and is dryed and I had my final product. With the sawgrass printer, I made a cup with the cleveland caveliers picture on it to show that I am a cavs fan. I did this by first making a file in CorrelDraw then I put the file into the computer which would transfer the job to the machine to put on the cup then after that I put the cup into some water to cool it down then I would have to take off some covering I put on when I first did the job and I got my great caveliers cup.</p>
